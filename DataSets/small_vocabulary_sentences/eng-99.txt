She was about to go out.
Take the money with you.
They got out of the car.
This house is very good.
This is all that I know.
This is not about money.
This is not good at all.
Tom would never do that.
We had no help from Tom.
You have what they want.
He was here at that time.

She has a lot of work to do.
She will be here in no time.
That is what I want to know.
This is what you have to do.
Tom and Mary want to see us.
Tom could do with some help.
Tom must be up to something.
We have a lot of work to do.
We should do this every day.
You can come if you want to.
You should come out with us.
Come on, Tom, think about it.

Please do something about it.
That is all I know about him.
They, too, were out of money.
This is all the money I have.
This is what we want to know.
Tom and Mary want to see you.
Tom and Mary will go with me.
Tom has a lot to think about.
Tom has more money than I do.
Tom thought about Mary a lot.
Tom will have to do the work.
We have to do something, Tom.
We must do something to help.
You do not have to come here.
You know what you have to do.
A lot of people need our help.
I can get you one if you like.
I go to work by car every day.
I need to know more about Tom.
I think you know what I think.
I thought you should see this.
I want to know what you think.
If I want something, I get it.
This is what I can do for you.
Tom would help us if he could.
We just want to take Tom home.
He has something to do with it.
I just need more time with Tom.
I know what they want me to do.
I think about him all the time.
I think about you all the time.
I think we should do some more.
I think your work is very good.
There are a lot of people here.
This is something I have to do.
Tom thought no one was at home.
He will come to see us some day.
I could never do it like you do.
I just need you to come with me.
I need to get something for Tom.
I think Tom will do that for us.
I think we have more work to do.
I thought Tom was here with you.
I would like to come to see you.
It would be good if I had a car.
The more I get, the more I want.
This one is as good as that one.
Tom, I want you to come with me.
We have to do the work in a day.
You can go there if you want to.
I know that you know that I know.
I thought Tom would want to know.
I want to know what time to come.
I want you to take this with you.
I would like to come and see you.
I would like you to come with me.
If I were you, I would not do it.
She is not what you think she is.
There is no need for him to work.
There is something you must know.
There were a lot of people there.
I do not like him, but I like her.
I think you know I like you a lot.
I thought Tom would want the work.
I thought Tom would want this one.
I want you to do something for me.
If I had time to do that, I would.
This is all that I know about him.
Tom is not like that all the time.
I do not think that she is at home.
I need some time to think about it.
I will get him to come and help me.
There must be something you can do.
Tom and I want you to come with us.
We have to do something about this.
He has a lot more money than I have.
I thought Tom would want to help me.
I would like you to go home with me.
I have something that you should see.
I think about that from time to time.
I thought Tom would like to see this.
I thought Tom would want to see this.
I want you to do what you have to do.
The more you have, the more you want.
Tom has a lot more money than I have.
Every time I go to his house, he is out.
If you want to go out with Tom, you can.
Please come and see me if you have time.
Tom must have been at home at that time.
I have no time to help you with the work.
I thought it must be something like that.
I want you to get the help that you need.
The more I know him, the more I like him.
If you want to come with us, come with us.
She thought she could get him to like her.
I want every day to be as good as this one.
I thought Tom would want to know about that.
I went to her house, but she was not at home.
