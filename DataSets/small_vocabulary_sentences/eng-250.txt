Let me think for a while.
Mary had to go to school.
My father has many books.

My wish is to please you.
Never be this late again.
Next year will be better.
No one can do it but you.
No one knows Tom is here.
No one knows what to say.
No one wants to go there.
Not everyone is like you.
Now, go have a good time.

My house is a long way from here.
One is new, and the other is old.
Our teacher told us what to read.
Please let me know what you want.
She asked him to read it for her.
She came to see me the other day.
She has to look after her mother.

We still have a lot of food left.
We thought that you were married.
You can stay as long as you like.
You had better not see her today.
You may stay here if you want to.
You may talk as much as you like.
You must always do what is right.

She wanted him to help her father.
She wants him to be just a friend.

The old man lost the will to live.
They married when they were young.
They wanted to know where Tom was.

This is all that I know about him.
This is the book I told you about.
To make money one must want money.

My little brother can read English.
No one here seems to want our help.
Please leave my things as they are.
Please tell me where you will live.
Right now my father is not at home.
Tell him not to be late for school.
There must be something you can do.
They all tried to talk at one time.
They did not know what to do first.

You may come with us if you want to.
You must do what seems right to you.
You should have told me that before.

You must not look down on old people.
All I know is that she left last week.
He left everything to her in his will.
He said he would come and he did come.
Her mother is not as old as she looks.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
I did not think that he would help us.
I do not know when she will come back.
I do not live to eat, but eat to live.
I just want to say you did a good job.
I like this book better than that one.
I need to know what I should tell Tom.
I said that I could, not that I would.
I see you going by my house every day.
I think Tom knows about John and Mary.
I think this is the best way to do it.

It was late at night when we got back.
My mother has made me what I am today.

Only a few people know how to do that.
Our English teacher is always on time.
She came here as soon as she heard it.
She likes no one and no one likes her.
She told him that her father had died.

Too little is just as bad as too much.
We must make do with what we have got.
When I looked at her, she looked down.
You can stay here as long as you like.
All I really want to do is talk to Tom.
All the people who were here have left.
He had nothing to say, so he went away.
He had to look for his room by himself.
He is said to have been a good teacher.
He took back what he had said about me.
I have had to stay in bed for two days.
I have something to talk over with you.
I just wish I knew how to speak French.

I want to talk to you before you leave.
I want you to read this English letter.
I was at home almost all day yesterday.

I would like to see you before I leave.
It looks like she has a lot of friends.

We are just in time for the last train.
We want to talk to you about a problem.
What I want now is not money, but time.
What Tom really wanted was to be happy.
You should eat something before you go.
At first, I thought he was your brother.
Come here. I need to tell you something.
Every time I go to his house, he is out.
For all we know, Tom could be in Boston.
He came to see you right after you left.
I am happy to have so many good friends.
I had a good talk with Tom this morning.
I had never been late for school before.
I have better things to do with my time.

I thought Tom would know how to do that.

Not everything can be bought with money.
Please come and see me if you have time.
Please tell me how to get to your house.
She gave him all the money that she had.
She gave up everything for her children.
She had, I thought, no right to do that.

By the way, I have something to tell you.
Every time I go to see him, he is in bed.
First of all, you have to read this book.
He gave the boy what little money he had.

She has been out of work these two years.
That has nothing to do with this problem.
The last time I came here was a year ago.
The more I know him, the more I like him.

There are some things we want you to see.
They were in that room with me all night.

Hard work has made Japan what it is today.
He was the only one who came to the party.
Her father left her the house in his will.

I thought you were going to talk with Tom.
If you want to come with us, come with us.
It seems as if you are the first one here.
She has been married to him for two years.
She thought she could get him to like her.
She was very beautiful when she was young.
Some of my friends can speak English well.
The people who live there are our friends.
This is a better house than the other one.
This is the book I want to give my mother.

You have to make up the time you have lost.
I got a letter from an old friend yesterday.
I just want to be your friend, nothing more.
I just want to talk with you a little while.
I looked all over the house for that letter.
I thought Tom would want to know about that.
If he were happy, he would play much better.
One of you two is going to have to go there.
Some people talk too much and do too little.
Tell Tom about what you did the other night.
That house is really better than this house.
The best time of life is when you are young.
The children were all well and looked happy.
There has to be a first time for everything.

You may go out as long as you came back soon.
He said that he would come back here tomorrow.
I am not the man I was when you knew me first.
I heard that Tom is going to get married soon.
I just want to know what you did this morning.
I think Tom is too young to really be in love.
I thought that he knew everything about Japan.
I tried to get Tom and Mary to play with John.
I wanted to let you know that I would be late.
If you want to speak to me, please call me up.
It would be better for you to read more books.
My father often told us about his school days.
Please just tell me what it is you want to do.

It seems like just yesterday that we first met.
The same man that came yesterday is here again.
There should be something for us to talk about.
Tom and Mary have been friends for a long time.
Tom and Mary have been friends for three years.
We are not too young to tell what love is like.
We went to Boston last year for the first time.

I know Tom and Mary were more than just friends.
I want life to go back to the way it was before.
I wish I had the time to stay and talk with you.
I wish that I could speak French as well as Tom.
If you really like Mary, you should ask her out.
It seems like just yesterday that you were here.
It would be better for you to stay in bed today.
Many people are better off than they used to be.
Never put off to tomorrow what you can do today.
She asked him to stay, but he had to go to work.
The next time I tell you to do something, do it.
The only one who has a problem with this is you.
The only way to have a friend is to be a friend.

There always seems like there is something to do.
They say that you never get over your first love.
Tom had a lot of time to think about the problem.
When my mother was young, she was very beautiful.
Every time I went to see him, I found him at work.
He looked at all the beautiful things in my house.
He looked much better this morning than yesterday.
He was about to call her up, when her letter came.

I tried to help her, but there was no way I could.

I thought you were going to be at the party last night.
My father bought this house for us when we got married.
There are a lot of things I have to do before tomorrow.
Tom came to Japan for the first time when he was three.
We often do what we have to do, not what we want to do.
What Tom really wanted was some time with his children.
Tell us more about what you did when you were in Boston.
