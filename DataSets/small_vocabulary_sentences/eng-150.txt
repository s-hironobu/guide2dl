You can come if you want to.
You can have it for nothing.
You must do as you are told.
You should come out with us.

This is all you have to do now.
This is how it has always been.
This is something I have to do.

Tom told me that we were out of time.
Yesterday was the last day of school.
You are the only one who can help me.

You have only to do as you were told.
You must not look down on old people.
He said he would come and he did come.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
I did not think that he would help us.
