It would be good if I had a car.
Just tell Tom what we found out.

There seems to be no need to go.

He left Japan never to come back.
He read a really long book today.
He read the letter over and over.
He told me to do it, so I did it.
He was too young to go to school.
He went into the water before me.
He went to see her the other day.
His brother came home soon after.
His mother is an English teacher.
I am not a doctor, but a teacher.
I am not the person I used to be.
I asked him if he wanted a watch.
I asked him to go there tomorrow.
I bought this book the other day.
I do not know anything about him.
I do what is best for my country.
I had to do everything on my own.
I had to give Tom a little money.
I have a lot of books in my room.
I have looked for it up and down.
I have the best job in the world.
I have to give this book to Mary.
I have to go there for my father.
I have to go to the doctor today.
I hope I can get my old job back.
I just got a letter from my girl.
I just want to make it up to you.
I just wanted to see if you knew.
I know that you know that I know.
I know that you will learn a lot.
I know you better than you think.
I know you want to make me happy.
I left one of my books at school.
I love you more than you love me.
I need to know how this happened.
I need to know where to put this.
I never heard anything like that.
I ran into your father yesterday.
I read a lot of books in English.
I really do want Tom to be happy.
I saw your brother the other day.
I speak French every day at work.
I speak French with Tom and Mary.
I still have a lot of work to do.
I think Tom and Mary are in love.
I think that we should try again.
I think the train will come soon.
I think you should tell Tom that.
I thought I told you not to come.
I thought I was your best friend.
I thought Tom had left with Mary.
I thought Tom would want it back.
I thought Tom would want to know.
I thought you already have a job.
I thought you might want to know.
I thought you said you had a dog.
I thought you were going to help.
I told you Tom would help us out.
I want to know how you know that.
I want to know what time to come.
I want to know who gave you that.
I want to know who told you that.
I want to speak with Tom, please.
I want to talk to Tom about Mary.
I want to tell you what happened.

I want you to stay here with her.
I want you to stay where you are.
I want you to take some time off.
I want you to take this with you.
I wanted Tom to take me with him.
I wanted to speak with you first.
I will not go to school tomorrow.
I will tell you more about Japan.
I wish I could go with you today.
I wish I had been there with you.
I wish you could have been there.
I wish you were here with me now.
I would do anything to get a job.
I would like to come and see you.
I would like you to come with me.
If I were you, I would not do it.
If you ask him, he will help you.
If you want us to help, just ask.
It happened more than a year ago.
It is a little late for that now.
It just was not my day yesterday.
It was the best night of my life.
Let me tell you what I did today.
Let us never speak of this again.
May has been in Japan for a year.
My family is always there for me.
My father gave me a lot of money.
My friend wants a car of his own.
My house is a long way from here.
My mother does not speak English.
No students went there yesterday.
Nobody but you can make me happy.
Nobody knows Tom like I know Tom.
One is new, and the other is old.
Our teacher told us what to read.
Please let me know what you want.
She asked him to read it for her.
She came to see me the other day.
She does not do things like that.
She has to look after her mother.
She is beautiful like her mother.
She is not as young as she looks.
She is not what you think she is.
She might have met him yesterday.
She was about to leave the house.
She was already in love with him.
Some of us will be at your party.
Something has happened to my car.
Something is better than nothing.
Something is wrong with my watch.
Tell me what you think about Tom.
Tell me where to put these books.
That is the house where he lives.
That was the best day of my life.
That was the last time I saw Tom.
The cat seems to want some water.
The party was put off for a week.
The students made her life happy.
The three of us get on very well.
There is no need for him to work.
There is something you must know.
There were a lot of people there.
They could not find work at home.
They had had that problem before.
They have been married two years.
This book is hard for me to read.
This has never been tried before.
This is not a cat. This is a dog.
Today is the best day of my life.
Tom and Mary are my best friends.
Tom and Mary both looked at John.
Tom and Mary help each other out.
Tom and Mary want to talk to you.
Tom asked Mary to come to Boston.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
Tom bought Mary something to eat.
Tom came all the way from Boston.
Tom can speak French and English.
Tom got a letter from Mary today.
Tom had nothing to eat yesterday.
Tom had to do everything himself.
Tom has been to Boston only once.
Tom just wanted to be left alone.
Tom knew that Mary was a teacher.
Tom knows he did something wrong.
Tom knows how to make Mary happy.
Tom knows the man Mary came with.
Tom never told me he was married.
Tom never went to see Mary again.
Tom said Mary was good at French.
Tom should ask Mary how to do it.
Tom should have been here by now.
Tom thought about what Mary said.
Tom told Mary and Mary told John.
Tom told Mary that she was right.
Tom told Mary that she was wrong.
Tom told Mary to go talk to John.
Tom tried to stay away from Mary.
Tom wanted Mary to look for John.
Tom wanted to ask Mary something.
Tom wanted to be like his father.
Tom wants to live in the country.
Tom wants to tell you about Mary.
Tom was the only man in the room.
Tom will be here only a few days.
Tom, I want to ask you something.
We have been together for a year.
We still have a lot of food left.
We thought that you were married.
You can stay as long as you like.
You had better not see her today.
You may stay here if you want to.
You may talk as much as you like.
You must always do what is right.
You must make your parents happy.
You must study English every day.
You should get married in Boston.
You should leave it for tomorrow.
All the students come from the US.
As I see it, that is the best way.
As soon as he saw me, he ran away.
He gave me food and money as well.
He had nothing to say, so he left.
He has never been late for school.
He is better today than yesterday.
He is still too young for the job.
He is too young to go there alone.
He knows how to speak to children.
He lives in that house over there.
He said good night to his parents.
He said that he wanted some money.
He seems to have left the country.
He tried to make up for lost time.
I always knew Tom would come back.
I asked the man what his name was.
I can do my job without your help.
I can get you everything you need.
I could never go back there again.
I did everything I was told to do.
I did not see her for a long time.
I do as little as I can to get by.
I do not like him, but I like her.
I had a little help from a friend.
I have a little something for you.
I have a lot of friends in Boston.
I have been married for ten years.
I have just come back from school.
I have something good to tell you.
I hope to see my parents tomorrow.
I just need to know what happened.
I just wanted to get it over with.
I knew you were going to ask that.
I know little or nothing about it.
I know what the three of you want.
I like nobody and nobody likes me.
I like to read before I go to bed.
I must take something for my cold.
I need you to take a look at this.
I never want to talk to Tom again.
I never want to talk to you again.
I only told Tom what Mary told me.
I saw them over there a while ago.
I study about two hours every day.
I think that there is a man there.
I think we should buy a new house.
I think you know I like you a lot.
I thought Tom and Mary were happy.
I thought Tom would want the work.
I thought Tom would want this one.
I thought it might be of some use.
I thought it would be here by now.
I thought the play went very well.
I thought things would get better.
I thought you had lost your watch.
I thought you might need our help.
I thought you said you were alone.
I thought you were my best friend.
I told Tom to stay away from Mary.
I told you not to call me at work.
I want my mother to get well soon.
I want to talk with you about Tom.
I want you to do something for me.
I wanted to talk to you about Tom.
I was with friends all last night.
I wish I had as much money as Tom.
I wish I had as much money as you.
I wish Tom was here with us today.
If I had time to do that, I would.
If you want to stay, you can stay.
It happened that he saw her there.
It is better for you to do it now.
It is the car that we have wanted.
It might be good if you bought it.
It seems that he knows everything.
It seems to me that I have it all.
It seems to me that you are wrong.
Let me tell you everything I know.
Mary is going to help us tomorrow.
May you all get what you wish for.
My father is a teacher of English.
My mother died when I was a child.
Please give me a little more time.
Please tell me about your problem.
Please tell me where you got this.
Put it back where you got it from.
Reading your letter made me happy.
She must have been very beautiful.
She wanted him to help her father.
She wants him to be just a friend.
She was the first one to help him.
She went to see him the other day.
Tell Tom we want to talk with him.
That is not how we do things here.
The old man lost the will to live.
There are ten people in this room.
They got off at the next bus stop.
They just wanted to be left alone.
They made me wait for a long time.
They married when they were young.
They wanted to know where Tom was.
They were all friends as children.
This is all that I know about him.
This is how the accident happened.
This is the book I told you about.
To make money one must want money.

Too bad you have to leave already.
Try to make good use of your time.
We have all the time in the world.
We have to look after our parents.
We still have a little money left.
Without water, you could not live.
You get more beautiful every year.
You had better not go there again.
You learn something new every day.
You may not have heard about this.
You must do as you are told to do.
You will get well in a week or so.
Your sister can not speak English.
All I wanted was to make you happy.
All of my friends can speak French.
All you have to do is do your best.
Both of my parents love each other.
Everyone knew he would not be back.
Good things come to those who wait.

I would like to tell you something.
It was very cold yesterday morning.
John met Mary on his way to school.
Mary came up to me when she saw me.
My little brother can read English.
My sister is a very beautiful girl.
No one here seems to want our help.
Please leave my things as they are.
Please tell me where you will live.
Right now my father is not at home.
Something may have happened to him.
Something was wrong with the watch.
Students should try not to be late.
Tell him not to be late for school.
Tell that person where my house is.
That man is in love with my sister.
The only person I know here is Tom.
There must be something you can do.
They all looked for the lost child.
They all tried to talk at one time.
They did not know what to do first.
This is all that I can say for now.
This is always the way it has been.
This is the very best way to do it.

We really need a man like you here.
We were on the train for ten hours.
Where there is life, there is hope.
While there is life, there is hope.
Without money, he could do nothing.
You are the very man I want to see.
You can use my car, if you want to.
You have to make your own bed here.
You must try and come to the party.

I would not be the same without you.
If I had time, I would study French.
If you can come tomorrow, please do.
In Japan, all children go to school.
It looks like Tom likes his new job.
Just tell me what you want me to do.
Mother left some of the food for me.
My brother and I like the same food.

She came up to me and asked my name.
She knows nothing about your family.
She made friends with him in Boston.
Tell Tom Mary has already told John.
Tell me what you think about my car.
That house is much better than this.

What I want now is something to eat.
You can have this watch for nothing.
You look just like your big brother.
You may come with us if you want to.
You may have read this book already.
You must do what seems right to you.
You should have told me that before.
You should not give him up for lost.
As soon as I got home, I went to bed.
At last, he found out how to make it.
Everybody wants to live a happy life.
Father is out, but Mother is at home.
He asked me if I could speak English.
He came to Japan when he was a child.

I just wanted to tell you I love you.
I live about three hours from Boston.
I met him on my way home from school.

I want you to do what you have to do.
I wanted to speak in French with Tom.
I will come to your country some day.
I will have to be away for some time.
I wish I could take back what I said.
If you have something to say, say it.
It is already a little late for that.
It is not good for her to live alone.
It looks like Tom got what he wanted.
It seems that something has happened.
It seems to me that we should go now.
It was made to look like an accident.
Many lives were lost in the accident.
Many things happened on the same day.
Please say that once again in French.
Please tell me where you bought that.
Put the book back where you found it.
She asked him to come into her house.
She asked him to give her some money.
She bought a new house the other day.
She was asked to give him some money.
She was beautiful when she was young.
Something might have happened to her.
Take any books that you want to read.
Tell me something about your country.
That boy is in love with his teacher.
The cat is playing with the children.
The coffee is just the way I like it.
The girl I told you about lives here.
The more one has, the more one wants.
The more you have, the more you want.
The problem is that we have no money.
The two friends got on well together.
There is something wrong with my car.
There was a lot of food in the house.
There was almost nothing in the room.
There were many children in the room.
They have been married for ten years.
This is something I need to do alone.

You are the only one who can help me.

You have only to do as you were told.
You must not look down on old people.
All I know is that she left last week.
He left everything to her in his will.
He lost the watch he bought yesterday.
He said he would come and he did come.
He told me that he had lost his watch.
He will learn to do it in three hours.
Her mother is not as old as she looks.
I already told you it was an accident.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
I did not think that he would help us.
I do not know when she will come back.
I do not live to eat, but eat to live.
I had nothing to do with the accident.
I just want to find out what happened.
I just want to say you did a good job.
I like this book better than that one.
I lost my watch, so I have to buy one.
I need to know what I should tell Tom.
I said that I could, not that I would.
I saw an old friend of mine yesterday.
I see you going by my house every day.
I think Tom knows about John and Mary.
I think this is the best way to do it.
I think we have to wait a little more.
I thought it was Tom, but it was John.

It was late at night when we got back.
My mother has made me what I am today.
My mother said that she was all right.
Nobody here knows what Tom looks like.
Nobody is too old to learn new things.
Now is the time when we need him most.
Only a few people know how to do that.
Our English teacher is always on time.
She came here as soon as she heard it.
She likes no one and no one likes her.
She told him that her father had died.
She told me that I could use her room.
The more you study, the more you know.
There is no need for you to stay here.
There is only one bus every two hours.
There was nothing I could do about it.
There were a few children in the room.
They say that she is in love with him.

Tom will tell us what we need to know.
Too little is just as bad as too much.
We must make do with what we have got.
When I looked at her, she looked down.
You can stay here as long as you like.
You should make good use of your time.
All I really want to do is talk to Tom.
All the people who were here have left.
He had nothing to say, so he went away.
He had to look for his room by himself.
He is going to study English next week.
He is said to have been a good teacher.
He took back what he had said about me.
I can get one of those any time I want.
I go to school because I want to learn.
I have already been here for two hours.
I have been reading a book all morning.
I have had to stay in bed for two days.
I have something to talk over with you.
I just wish I knew how to speak French.
I knew there would be something to eat.
I know Tom had nothing to do with this.
I know a man who can speak French well.
I like to talk about the good old days.
I met him yesterday for the first time.
I met one of my friends on my way home.
I never felt this way before I met you.
I ran into Mary at the party last week.
I ran into a friend of mine on the bus.
I think Tom could learn a lot from you.
I think you could do that if you tried.
I thought Tom died last year in Boston.
I thought it was about time we all met.
I want the same watch as my sister has.
I want to get married, just not to you.
I want to know more about your country.
I want to talk to you before you leave.
I want you to know you did a great job.
I want you to read this English letter.
I was at home almost all day yesterday.
I wish that I could give you something.
I wish there were more people like you.
I would like to see you again some day.
I would like to see you before I leave.
If you do it at all, try to do it well.
It looks like she has a lot of friends.
It seems like Tom wants to talk to you.
It seems that you are very happy today.
Japan is not what it was ten years ago.
Let me tell you something about Boston.
My little brother asked for some money.
My sister is too young to go to school.
Nobody told me what time I should come.
She always looked happy, but never was.
She asked me to help her with the work.
She made friends with Tom at the party.
She said she had heard of the accident.
She told me his name after he had left.
Tell them to call me before they leave.
The accident happened a year ago today.
The teacher made him stay after school.
The watch I lost the other day was new.
There are a lot of things I have to do.
There are many bad people in the world.
There were a lot of people in the room.
They always talk about the same things.
They are the people who live next door.
This is the book that I told you about.
Tom always looked happy, but never was.
Tom and Mary are married to each other.
Tom asked Mary how to get to her house.
Tom came to my house yesterday morning.
Tom can speak French better than I can.
Tom could be in Boston for a long time.
Tom had nothing to do, so he went home.
Tom has everything a person could want.
Tom has nothing better to do right now.
Tom is the only person who can help me.
Tom knows he has to help Mary tomorrow.
Tom never asked me what I wanted to do.
Tom said he could give Mary some money.
Tom said he thought Mary was with John.
Tom told me not to say anything to you.
Tom wants me to take Mary to the party.
Tom was never really in love with Mary.
Tom went to the same school that I did.
We are just in time for the last train.
We want to talk to you about a problem.
What I want now is not money, but time.
What Tom really wanted was to be happy.
You should eat something before you go.
At first, I thought he was your brother.
Before I met you, I never felt this way.
Come here. I need to tell you something.
Every time I go to his house, he is out.
For all we know, Tom could be in Boston.
He came to see you right after you left.
He has as many books as his father does.
He is the last person I want to see now.
He told me that his father was a doctor.
I am happy to have so many good friends.
I had a good talk with Tom this morning.
I had never been late for school before.
I have better things to do with my time.
I know of her, but I have never met her.
I lost the watch that my father gave me.
I need to know everything that happened.
I need to know what happened last night.
I really wish I could be there with you.
I thought Tom would know how to do that.
I thought Tom would never see you again.
I thought Tom would want to take a look.
I thought you said Tom was your brother.
I thought you wanted to get out of here.
I want Tom to know what really happened.
I want life to be the way it was before.
I want to get married and have children.
I want to make friends with your sister.
I wish I could go to the party with you.
I wish I could help you find a good job.
I wish I could stay here with you today.
I wish I had more time to talk with her.
I wish I had more time to talk with you.
I wish you had come to see me yesterday.
If you have nothing to say, say nothing.
If you want to go out with Tom, you can.
It took me three days to read this book.
It would be best if I met him in person.
Not everything can be bought with money.
Please come and see me if you have time.
Please tell me how to get to your house.
She gave him all the money that she had.
She gave up everything for her children.
She had, I thought, no right to do that.
She looked after my children last night.
She read the letter over and over again.
The lost child was found after two days.
There were a lot of people at the party.
They were the first to get into the bus.
This is the only way to get Tom to stop.
Tom and Mary have just bought a new car.
Tom and Mary just got married last year.
Tom asked Mary and her friends for help.
Tom asked Mary what she thought of John.
Tom is all alone with no one to talk to.
Tom is the one who told me how to do it.
Tom must have been at home at that time.
Tom must have heard about what happened.
Tom said he never wanted to get married.
Tom said that he wanted to learn French.
Tom wanted his children to learn French.
Tom wanted to be like his brother, John.
Tom was friends with both Mary and John.
Tom was the last one to leave the party.
Tom went to the same school as Mary did.
Tom would like to buy a house in Boston.
What they wanted was a man like himself.
You can stay with us for the time being.
You have only to give him a little help.
You never told me that you were married.
You should have told me a long time ago.
By the way, I have something to tell you.
Every time I go to see him, he is in bed.
First of all, you have to read this book.
He did everything he could for his child.
He gave the boy what little money he had.
He saw the accident on his way to school.
I asked her if she could go to the party.
I had to give Tom time to think about it.
I have no time to help you with the work.
I study French for three hours every day.
I think that the train will be here soon.
I think we should tell Tom what we think.
I thought Tom and Mary would get married.
I thought it must be something like that.
I thought you were going to wait for Tom.
I want to ask them when their big day is.
I want to know what happened to your car.
I want you to get the help that you need.
I want you to go back to Boston tomorrow.
I wanted Tom to know what happened to us.
I wish I could think of something to say.
If you want your money back, just say so.
It was already late, so I went back home.
My father used to say that time is money.
My friend said he had bought a new watch.
My friends will give me a party tomorrow.
My little sister can read books well now.
Please tell me about you and your family.
She has been out of work these two years.
That has nothing to do with this problem.
The first person I met in Boston was Tom.
The food was so good that I ate too much.
The last time I came here was a year ago.
The more I know him, the more I like him.
The three of them all just looked at Tom.
There are some things we want you to see.
They really wanted to know what happened.
They were in that room with me all night.
Tom always seems to be reading something.
Tom and Mary got married a few years ago.
Tom and Mary have been married for years.
Tom asked Mary if she had been to Boston.
Tom first came to Boston three years ago.
Tom had heard nothing about the accident.
Tom is the only one who can help you now.
Tom ran to the door and tried to get out.
Tom really knows how to have a good time.
Tom thought about what Mary had told him.
Tom wanted to know everything about Mary.
Tom wants Mary to know that he likes her.
Tom was late for work again this morning.
Tom will do everything you ask him to do.
We go to school because we want to learn.
Work while you work, play while you play.
You are just the same as you always were.
You know I would do anything to help you.
You must live your life the best you can.
At first I did not like him, but now I do.
Hard work has made Japan what it is today.
He was the only one who came to the party.
Her father left her the house in his will.
His father left him the house in his will.
I have three friends who can speak French.
I met an old friend of mine the other day.
I need to know who I have to give this to.
I really thought we were going to do that.
I think Tom should ask for his money back.
I thought you might want to talk about it.
I thought you said you were an only child.
I thought you said you were bad at French.
I thought you were going to stay with Tom.
I thought you were going to talk with Tom.
If you want to come with us, come with us.
It seems as if you are the first one here.
Let me know if there is anything I can do.
She first met him when they were students.
She has been married to him for two years.
She thought she could get him to like her.
She was very beautiful when she was young.
Some of my friends can speak English well.
Some of the students were late for school.
The people who live there are our friends.
This is a better house than the other one.
This is the book I want to give my mother.
This is the very book that I want to read.
Tom and Mary both went to the same school.
Tom died just a few hours after Mary died.
Tom must have told Mary about John by now.
Tom told me that he wants to go to Boston.
Tom told me to give you anything you want.
Tom used to speak French better than Mary.
Tom was the last person to leave the room.
Tom went out to look for something to eat.
We have been good friends for a long time.
When I saw him last, he was still a child.
You get more and more beautiful every day.
A lot of people feel the same way Tom does.
All his family was around him when he died.
Ask me anything you want to know about Tom.
First, we have to find out where they live.
He bought a book and gave it to his father.
He is better off than he was ten years ago.
I have so many things I want to say to you.
I know that Mary is more beautiful than me.
I love you more than anything in the world.
I thought Tom would have found Mary by now.
I want every day to be as good as this one.
It happened that we were on the same train.
It seems that he is happy with his new job.
It so happened that I had no money with me.
Many students like to study in the morning.
More often than not, he is late for school.
Now is the time when we must work together.
Some of the students come to school by car.
That child wants some friends to play with.
These are my books and those are his books.
Those students are from a very good school.
Tom and Mary have been married three years.
Tom asked Mary about her new job in Boston.
Tom did his best to help Mary learn French.
Tom has to do something about this problem.
Tom is the only person who can do this job.
Tom looked at the man who had just come in.
Tom never read the book that Mary gave him.
Tom said that he wanted to make Mary happy.
Tom thought Mary would know where John was.
Tom told me that he wanted to go to Boston.
Tom wanted to ask Mary about how John died.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary about something.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary before she left.
Tom went to see Mary three days after that.
Tom would do anything for his sister, Mary.
Tom would never say what you think he said.
We must work hard to make up for lost time.
You have to make up the time you have lost.
Everybody knew she could speak English well.
Find Tom and ask him what you just asked me.
I got a letter from an old friend yesterday.
I just want to be your friend, nothing more.
I just want to talk with you a little while.
I looked all over the house for that letter.
I only speak French at home with my parents.
I thought Tom would want to know about that.
I wanted to talk to you about what happened.
If he were happy, he would play much better.
Nobody wants to do it, but one of us has to.
One of you two is going to have to go there.
Please just leave me alone. I want to think.
Some people talk too much and do too little.
Tell Tom about what you did the other night.
That house is really better than this house.
The best time of life is when you are young.
The children were all well and looked happy.
There has to be a first time for everything.
There was nothing Tom could do to help Mary.
They got married when they were still young.
They would tell us if they knew of anything.
This is the very book that I wanted to read.
Those are the children you gave the book to.
Tom and Mary are really made for each other.
Tom and Mary need to learn to work together.
Tom and Mary speak to each other in English.
Tom asked Mary to make him something to eat.
Tom asked Mary what she really wanted to do.
Tom is the only person who can do this work.
Tom is the only person who knows about this.
Tom really wanted to go to Boston with Mary.
Tom told Mary what he really thought of her.
Every time I see you, I think of your mother.
Give me back the book after you have read it.
He made her feel like he wanted her to leave.
I know that Mary is more beautiful than I am.
I lost the watch I had bought the day before.
I love you more than I love any other person.
I thought Tom would go to Boston to see Mary.
I thought we were going to try to be friends.
I want a car, but I have no money to buy one.
I went to her house, but she was not at home.
I will give you a call as soon as I get home.
If you do not have this book, you can buy it.
Just tell me what you know about the problem.
My doctor told me to stay at home for a week.
The teacher told us that over and over again.
These books are mine and those books are his.
Tom and Mary were told to stay in their room.
Tom has asked us to buy him something to eat.
Tom is the one who told me who to give it to.
Tom knew that he was going to need some help.
Tom likes to do almost everything by himself.
Tom will never tell you what really happened.
You may go out as long as you came back soon.
Find Tom and tell him to come here right away.
He had no money and so could not buy any food.
He said that he would come back here tomorrow.
I am not the man I was when you knew me first.
I can talk about anything with my best friend.
I got a letter from a friend of mine in Japan.
I have some books that you might like to read.
I heard that Tom is going to get married soon.
I just asked because I thought you would know.
I just want to know what you did this morning.
I think Tom is too young to really be in love.
I thought that he knew everything about Japan.
I tried to get Tom and Mary to play with John.
I want to find out if Tom was at school today.
I wanted to let you know that I would be late.
If you want to speak to me, please call me up.
It would be better for you to read more books.
My father often told us about his school days.
Please just tell me what it is you want to do.
She will be happy to know you want to see her.
The man who lives next door to me is a doctor.
This young man knows little about his country.
Tom and I want to talk to you about something.
Tom does much better than Mary does at school.
Tom has as much right to be here as Mary does.
Tom told Mary that John would be at the party.
Tom told me that he could get us what we need.
Tom wants me to come back to see him tomorrow.
We did not help him, so he made it by himself.
When I heard that, I put two and two together.
When she was three years old, her father died.
You know where to find me if you want to talk.
You need to have friends who can help you out.
You should read many books when you are young.
All Tom wanted was for Mary to leave him alone.
He lost his father when he was three years old.
I buy things that I know I am not going to use.
I just thought you might want to eat something.
I just want you to know that I really love you.
I knew there was nothing you could do about it.
I stay home alone while my parents are at work.
I think I had better not say anything about it.
I thought Tom was going to take us to see Mary.
I thought Tom would look more like his brother.
I want you to take back what you said just now.
I want you to tell me everything that happened.
It seems like just yesterday that we first met.
It seems that something is wrong with this car.
It took me three hours to get here from Boston.
Like it or not, you have to do that right away.
My parents gave me a house when we got married.
The man reading a book over there is my father.
The same man that came yesterday is here again.
There should be something for us to talk about.
Tom and Mary could learn a lot from each other.
Tom and Mary have been friends for a long time.
Tom and Mary have been friends for three years.
Tom and Mary said they wanted to be left alone.
Tom had to wait for Mary for about three hours.
Tom is the last person I want to see right now.
We are not too young to tell what love is like.
We went to Boston last year for the first time.
Every time that I see you, I think of my father.
Everybody in that family has a car of their own.
I got together with some old friends last night.
I know Tom and Mary were more than just friends.
I said good night to my parents and went to bed.
I want Tom and Mary to say that they were wrong.
I want life to go back to the way it was before.
I wish I had the time to stay and talk with you.
I wish that I could speak French as well as Tom.
If you really like Mary, you should ask her out.
It seems like just yesterday that you were here.
It would be better for you to stay in bed today.
Many people are better off than they used to be.
Never put off to tomorrow what you can do today.
She asked him to stay, but he had to go to work.
The next time I tell you to do something, do it.
The only one who has a problem with this is you.
The only way to have a friend is to be a friend.
There is a man at the door who wants to see you.
Tom and Mary bought a house in Boston last year.
Tom has a lot of people to see tomorrow morning.
Tom may have been in Boston with Mary last week.
Tom never thought about Mary while she was away.
Tom was the only person in the room at the time.
We must love our country as we love our parents.
What Tom really wanted was for Mary to be happy.
He has a lot of money, but has almost no friends.
I thought that I told you to stay where you were.
I thought you wanted to go to the party with Tom.
I took time off from work and went to the doctor.
I want to buy the same car that Tom wants to buy.
I wanted to talk to you because I need your help.
I will have him come here the day after tomorrow.
I will take my mother out in my new car tomorrow.
I wish I could do everything that I wanted to do.
It took them some time to get used to each other.
It was ten years ago that he first came to Japan.
It was when he was a child that he came to Japan.
She lost her father when she was three years old.
Some people think French is really hard to learn.
There always seems like there is something to do.
They say that you never get over your first love.
Tom had a lot of time to think about the problem.
When my mother was young, she was very beautiful.
You can ask the child that is playing over there.
After his father died, he had to study by himself.
Every time I read this book, I find something new.
Every time I went to see him, I found him at work.
He looked at all the beautiful things in my house.
He looked much better this morning than yesterday.
He was about to call her up, when her letter came.
I think Tom and Mary are too young to get married.
I thought Tom would speak French better than Mary.
I tried to help her, but there was no way I could.
I tried to help him, but there was no way I could.
I want my children to have the best of everything.
If I had to study, I would stay at home every day.
It was hard for me to get out of bed this morning.
Let me eat this one and you can eat the other one.
She married him only because her parents made her.
There are a lot of people who want to talk to Tom.
This is the man that I see every day on the train.
Tom wanted Mary to stay at home with the children.
Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.
I hope he will not let us down again by being late.
I only did that because I had nothing better to do.
I thought we could go out and get something to eat.
I want the name of everyone who was here yesterday.
I wanted to help, but there was nothing I could do.
My father used to say that money is not everything.
My mother is the first one to get up every morning.
There is nothing to do, so I may as well go to bed.
Tom and Mary both wanted to go to Boston with John.
Tom and Mary got married when they were very young.
Tom might be better at French than you think he is.
A man who wanted to see you came while you were out.
For all Tom knew, Mary might be in Boston with John.
He told his mother that he would study the next day.
I thought you were going to do something about that.
I want you to tell me everything you know about Tom.
It is never too late to be what you could have been.
Not only Tom has to study, but I have to study, too.
One of the people you were with is a friend of mine.
There is no one here who can help you with the work.
Tom first came to Japan when he was three years old.
You should have told him about it while he was here.
He does not study hard, but does very well at school.
It is better for you not to eat before you go to bed.
The new teacher is more like a friend than a teacher.
Tom and I were married to each other for three years.
Tom asked Mary how many people had come to her party.
When I met her the other day she asked of my parents.
You should look after the children from time to time.
Call me if you want to do something together tomorrow.
I found something that I think you might want to read.
I heard Tom speak French yesterday for the first time.
I just wanted to tell you I ran into Tom this morning.
I thought Tom would ask Mary to go to Boston with him.
I thought Tom would ask Mary to go with him to Boston.
If you really want to know, all you have to do is ask.
If you really want to know, all you need to do is ask.
Tom told me that I could keep the book if I wanted it.
You should read a book like the one he is reading now.
He went on reading the book as if nothing had happened.
I thought you were going to be at the party last night.
My father bought this house for us when we got married.
There are a lot of things I have to do before tomorrow.
Think of what you are reading while you are reading it.
Tom came to Japan for the first time when he was three.
We often do what we have to do, not what we want to do.
What Tom really wanted was some time with his children.
First of all, you should talk it over with your parents.
I did so, not because I wanted to, but because I had to.
Tell us more about what you did when you were in Boston.
This is the house where I used to live when I was young.
Tom asked Mary if she was really happy with her new job.
Your mother must have been beautiful when she was young.
I want to find out how many people died in that accident.
It was never hard for us to find something to talk about.
The only time you talk to me is when you need some money.
Tom told Mary everything he knew about what had happened.
When I was a boy, I thought that I wanted to be a doctor.
You should have told me that you wanted me to come alone.
It was because of the accident that I was late for school.
Tom and Mary got married three years after they first met.
What Tom really wanted was a good friend he could talk to.
I have nothing to do with the accident, and I know nothing.
There were many things that Tom wanted Mary to do that day.
When I was young, I tried to read as many books as I could.
You got better because you did everything the doctor asked.
I thought about how much had happened in the last two hours.
There were many things that Tom wanted to do before he died.
I found something out about Tom that I think you should know.
I want to find out if Tom is going to go out and eat with us.
Tom thought that Mary would like to go to Boston to see John.
The problem is that that boy never does what he is told to do.
Tom asked Mary for some money so he could buy something to eat.
She told me once and for all that she did not want to see me again.
You speak French very well. I wish I could speak it as well as you.
