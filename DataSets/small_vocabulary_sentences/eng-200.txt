I went over to where Tom was.
I will help as much as I can.
I will speak to you tomorrow.
I would very much like to go.
If he has time, he will come.
If you want me to go, I will.
It looks like you were right.

She wants to go out with him.
She was there in the morning.
She will be back before long.
Something is still not right.
That is all I know about him.
There is nothing to do today.
There was no one left but me.
They are not little children.
They did what they were told.
They wanted something better.
They, too, were out of money.
This is all the money I have.
This is the only book I have.

As for me, I like this better.
First of all, I must say this.
Give me time to think it over.
He asked his friends for help.
He asked me what I had bought.
He can speak a little English.
He did as he said he would do.

She is the only friend I have.
Take as much time as you want.
Tell me what that man is like.
The old man asked me the time.
The way I see it, he is right.
There is no water in the well.
They do not know how to do it.

She is not home, but at school.
She may not come here tomorrow.
She told him that he was right.
She wants him to be her friend.
She will come back before long.
Tell me again that you love me.
That has nothing to do with it.
That has nothing to do with me.
There are a lot of people here.
There is a time for everything.
They made us work all day long.
This has nothing to do with me.
This is all you have to do now.

You have only to do as you were told.
You must not look down on old people.
He left everything to her in his will.
He said he would come and he did come.
Her mother is not as old as she looks.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
I did not think that he would help us.
I do not know when she will come back.
I do not live to eat, but eat to live.
I just want to say you did a good job.
I like this book better than that one.
I need to know what I should tell Tom.
I said that I could, not that I would.
I see you going by my house every day.
I thought that you could speak French.
I thought you were going out with Tom.
I told you that I would never give up.
I want you to take a good look at Tom.
I wanted to speak with you about this.
I was very happy to see my old friend.
My mother has made me what I am today.
My mother said that she was all right.

All the people who were here have left.
He had nothing to say, so he went away.
He took back what he had said about me.
I know Tom had nothing to do with this.
I know a man who can speak French well.
I would like to see you again some day.
I would like to see you before I leave.
It looks like she has a lot of friends.
Let me tell you something about Boston.
She asked me to help her with the work.
There were a lot of people in the room.
They are the people who live next door.
This is the book that I told you about.

Tom can speak French better than I can.
Tom could be in Boston for a long time.
Tom had nothing to do, so he went home.
Tom has nothing better to do right now.
Tom knows he has to help Mary tomorrow.
Tom never asked me what I wanted to do.
Tom said he could give Mary some money.
Tom was never really in love with Mary.
What I want now is not money, but time.
What Tom really wanted was to be happy.
You should eat something before you go.
Come here. I need to tell you something.
Every time I go to his house, he is out.
For all we know, Tom could be in Boston.
He came to see you right after you left.
I am happy to have so many good friends.
I thought Tom would know how to do that.
I thought Tom would never see you again.
I thought Tom would want to take a look.
I thought you wanted to get out of here.
I want life to be the way it was before.
If you have nothing to say, say nothing.
If you want to go out with Tom, you can.
Not everything can be bought with money.
Please come and see me if you have time.
Please tell me how to get to your house.
She gave him all the money that she had.
She gave up everything for her children.
She had, I thought, no right to do that.
Tom and Mary have just bought a new car.
Tom asked Mary and her friends for help.
Tom is the one who told me how to do it.
Tom must have been at home at that time.
You have only to give him a little help.
By the way, I have something to tell you.
First of all, you have to read this book.
He gave the boy what little money he had.
I had to give Tom time to think about it.
I have no time to help you with the work.
I think we should tell Tom what we think.
I thought it must be something like that.
I want you to get the help that you need.
I want you to go back to Boston tomorrow.
If you want your money back, just say so.
My father used to say that time is money.
She has been out of work these two years.
The more I know him, the more I like him.
They were in that room with me all night.
Tom asked Mary if she had been to Boston.
Tom is the only one who can help you now.
Tom really knows how to have a good time.
Tom thought about what Mary had told him.
